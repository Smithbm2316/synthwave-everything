# Synthwave Everything!

## What is Synthwave Everything?

Synthwave Everything is a repository dedicated to housing anything that pertains to synthwave-ifying your life! I'm a big fan of [@robb0wen](https://github.com/robb0wen/)'s VS Code theme called [Synthwave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/) and a big fan of the retrowave genre of music. All of these things have led me to a slightly unhealthy obsession of the look, feel, and sound of all things synthwave. So, I decided to try and make everything that I possibly could (that pertains to my dev environment or any tech in general) look and feel like it fits in with the synthwave aesthetic and sound.

## What is available in this repo?

Right now, there is only a theme for iTerm2 (a terminal emulator for MacOS). I plan to add much more as I continue to discover more synthwave-related assets and create more themes for the different applications I use. I hope you enjoy!
